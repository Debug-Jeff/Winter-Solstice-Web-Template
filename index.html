        <h2>Introduction to the <span>Winter Solstice.</span></h2>
        <p>The winter solstice is a significant astronomical event that marks the shortest day and the longest night of
            the year. It occurs annually in December in the Northern Hemisphere and in June in the Southern Hemisphere.
            This event has been observed and celebrated by cultures around the world for thousands of years, often
            symbolizing rebirth, reflection, and the triumph of light over darkness.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>The solstices occur due to the Earth's axial tilt of approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its
                        orbital plane around the Sun. This tilt causes different parts of the Earth to receive varying
                        amounts of sunlight throughout the year, leading to the changing seasons. During the winter
                        solstice, one hemisphere is tilted the farthest away from the Sun, resulting in the shortest
                        period
                        of daylight.</p>

                <div class="text-content-2">
                    <p>At the exact moment of the solstice, the Sun reaches its lowest maximum elevation in the sky. In
                        the Northern Hemisphere, this happens around December 21st or 22nd, when the Sun is directly over
                        the
                        Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5 degrees south latitude. In the Southern Hemisphere, the winter
                        solstice
                        occurs around June 20th or 21st, when the Sun is over the Tropic of Cancer at 23.5 degrees north
                        latitude.The solstice is a precise moment in time, but its effects are felt throughout the day.
                        The
                        term
                        "solstice" comes from the Latin words "sol" (sun) and "sistere" (to stand still), because the
                        Sun's
                        apparent movement north or south comes to a stop before reversing direction.</p>

            <h2>Solstice Across Hemispheres</h2>
        <p>The experience of the solstice differs greatly between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres due to their
            opposite seasons.</p>
        <article class="hemisphere" id="northern-hemisphere">
            <h3>Northern Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>In the Northern Hemisphere, the December solstice marks the beginning of winter. Countries like the
                United States, Canada, Russia, and much of Europe experience their shortest day and longest night. The
                weather typically becomes colder, and many cultures have developed traditions to bring light and warmth
                into this dark time of year.</p>

        <article class="hemisphere" id="southern-hemisphere">
            <h3>Southern Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, the December solstice signals the start of summer. Nations such
                as Australia, South Africa, and Argentina enjoy their longest day and shortest night. This time is
                associated with warmth, outdoor activities, and often, summer vacations.</p>
        </article>
        <p>This opposite experience of the solstice underscores the diversity of cultural responses to the same
            astronomical event, influenced by local climate and historical traditions.</p>
